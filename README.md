###  Identifying the most important index terms of an academic journal

An index term, subject term, subject heading, or descriptor, in information retrieval, is a term that captures the essence of the topic of a document. Index terms make up a controlled vocabulary for use in bibliographic records. They are an integral part of bibliographic control, which is the function by which libraries collect, organize and disseminate documents.


A list of index terms, a list of stop words, and a document are given. 
The document is parsed and the <b>top 3 index terms that have the highest keyword density</b> are identified and printed.

This is a challenge from <b>IEEE Xtreme 14.0</b>.
